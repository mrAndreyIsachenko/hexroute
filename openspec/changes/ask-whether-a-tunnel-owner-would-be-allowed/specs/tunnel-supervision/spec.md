# Tunnel Supervision Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The decision is recorded beside what the owner did

The runtime SHALL record each decision durably, and the record SHALL be
comparable against what the owning runtime actually did.

A decision that agreed and a decision that was never reached look the same in
an empty log. The comparison is the whole purpose of deciding without acting,
so the record SHALL exist on every cycle, including the cycles that decided to
do nothing.

#### Scenario: A cycle decides

- **WHEN** any cycle completes
- **THEN** its decision is recorded, whether or not it found a cause

#### Scenario: The owner acted

- **WHEN** the owning runtime rebuilt the tunnel
- **THEN** the record can be read to say whether this runtime would have, and for which cause
